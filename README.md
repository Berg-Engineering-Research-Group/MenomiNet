*About:* The goal of this project is to create a water quality monitor that is inexpensive and relatively simple to build.  Not only does this project work with a smaller budget, it has the additional feature of broadcasting the data received over UHF frequency. With some minor adjustments to the code, this can be done without the need for an amateur radio operator's license.
